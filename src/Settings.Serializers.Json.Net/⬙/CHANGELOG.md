## 3.2.0

:calendar: _2022-12-30_

### Added

- Added new custom converter `EnumConverter` that can write-out all values of enumeration properties during serialization.

### Fixed

- The `VersionConverter` could not be added via builder pattern because of missing extension methods.

## 3.1.0

:calendar: _2022-05-10_

### Added

- Added new custom converter `VersionConverter`.

### Fixed

- Comparing the structure of a settings instance with the underlying data potentially threw a `SettingsLoadException` because no serialization options where used for this process (e.g. no trailing comma handling). Now the `JsonSettingsSerializer` uses the same **JsonSerializerOptions** options for all its operations.
