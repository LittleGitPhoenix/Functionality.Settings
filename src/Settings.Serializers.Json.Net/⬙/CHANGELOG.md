## 3.1.0 (2022-05-10)

### Added

- Added new custom converter `VersionConverter`.

### Fixed

- Comparing the structure of a settings instance with the underlying data potentially threw a `SettingsLoadException` because no serialization options where used for this process (e.g. no trailing comma handling). Now the `JsonSettingsSerializer` uses the same **JsonSerializerOptions** options for all its operations.
